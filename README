If a chess game is played with a computer, the computer can use the following AIs: RandomAI, MiniMaxAI, AlphaBetaAI, SuperAlphaBetaAI
RandomAI chooses moves randomly
MiniMaxAI uses the minimax search algorithm
AlphaBetaAI uses the alpha-beta pruning technique along with a transposition table to improve search speed
SuperAlphaBetaAI is an extension of AlphaBetaAI that uses move reordering techniques to improve pruning and speed

To play with RandomAI set the aiType variable in ChessClient.java to "RANDOM"
To play with MiniMaxAI set the aiType variable in ChessClient.java to "MINIMAX"
To play with AlphaBetaAI set the aiType variable in ChessClient.java to "AB"
To play with SuperAlphaBetaAI set the aiType variable in ChessClient.java to "SUPER"

If a chess game is played with either AlphaBetaAI or SuperAlphaBetaAI, the computer can use an opening book
To enable the opening book set the openingGame variable in ChessClient.java to true
To disable the opening book set the openingGame variable in ChessClient.java to false

To use different starting positions, see the constructor for ChessGame.java
